The Cut Django App: Authorship

=================
thecut.authorship
=================

To install this application (whilst in the project's activated
virtualenv)::
    pip install git+ssh://git@git.thecut.net.au/thecut-authorship


There is no need to add ``thecut.authorship`` to your project's
``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting, as it provides only abstract models.
